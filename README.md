# Trust_WCAS_2021
Codes and data for "Modeling User's Trust in Drought Forecasts" in WCAS 2021
The three scripts can be used to generate probabilistic drought forecasts, model trust evolution, and assess ex ante and ex post forecast values.
The data needed (drought time series, forecast time series, and user's updated belief about drought based on forecast) to run the scripts can be found in InputData.xlsx.
The severn MATLAB data files include drought time series (20 scenarios) and forecast time series (1000 scenarios) used for the Value Score (VS) sensitivity analysis.
